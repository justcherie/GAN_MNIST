# GAN_MNIST
GAN trained on MNIST
Note that I only used 5 Epochs to run a fast test. Average Epoch run time on Colab was 785 seconds per Epoch.
For better quality, 50 Epochs is recommended.
Note that the model parameters are dense layers for both the generator and discriminator.
The output file runs a local animation of the results.
